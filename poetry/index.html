        <br />
        Well I used to know someone fair<br />
        She had orange ribbons in her hair<br />
        She was such a trip, she was hardly there<br />
        But I loved her, just the same<br />
        There was rain in our window<br />
        The FM set was ragged<br />
        But she could talk, yeah <br />
        We learned to speak<br />
        And one year has gone by<br />
        Such a long, long road to seek it<br />
        All we did was break and freak it<br />
        We had all that lovers ever had<br />
        We just blew it and I'm not sad<br />
        Well, I'm mad and I'm bad<br />
        And two years have gone by<br />
        Now her world was bright orange<br />
        And the fire glowed<br />
        And her friend had a baby<br />
        And she lived with us<br />
        Yeah, we broke through the window<br />
        Yeah, we knocked on the door<br />
        Her phone would not answer<br />

        Yeah, but she's still home<br />
        Now her father has passed over<br />
        And her sister is a star<br />
        And her mother smokes diamonds<br />
        And she sleeps out in the car<br />
        Yeah, but she remembers Chicago<br />
        The musicians and guitars<br />
        And grass by the lake<br />
        And people who laughed<br />
        And made her poor heart ache<br />
        Now we live down in the valley<br />
        We work out on the farm<br />
        We climb up to the mountains<br />
        And everything's fine and I'm still here<br />
        And you're still there and we're still around<br />

          Awake
        </h3>
        <br />

        Shake dreams from your hair <br />
        My pretty child, my sweet one. <br />
        Choose the day and <br />
        choose the sign of your day <br />
        The day’s divinity <br />
        First thing you see. <br />
        A vast radiant beach <br />
        in a cool jeweled moon <br />
        Couples naked race down by it’s quiet side <br />
        And we laugh like soft, mad children <br />
        Smug in the woolly cotton brains of infancy <br />
        The music and voices are all around us. <br />
        Choose, they croon, the Ancient Ones <br />
        The time has come again <br />
        Choose now, they croon, <br />
        Beneath the moon <br />
        Beside an ancient lake <br />
        Enter again the sweet forest <br />
        Enter the hot dream <br />
        Come with us <br />
        Everything is broken up and dances.

        <br />
        I can make the earth stop in <br />
        its tracks. I made the <br />
        blue cars go away.<br />
        I can make myself invisible or small.<br />
        <br />
        I can become gigantic and reach the <br />
        farthest things. I can change <br />
        the course of nature. <br />I can place myself anywhere <br />in space
        or time.<br />
        <br />
        I can summon the dead.<br />
        I can perceive events on other worlds,<br />
        in my deepest inner mind, <br />
        and in the minds of others.<br />
        <br />
        I can. <br />
        <br />
        I am.
