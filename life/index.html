            could dig the vibrations of the people around me" - Jim Morrison

            school. Manzarek discovers Morrison’s talent in his poetry, and the
            two form a band called The Doors.Also finished collage from
            University of California and didn't drop out due to fear of being
            drafted into the army.

            <time>1966</time> According to Ray Manzarek, Pam met the Doors at
            the Sunset Strip club The London Fog early 1966: "Pam walked into
            the Fog and john Densmore certainly put the make on her and for the
            next week or so continued to put the make on her. I don't know what
            happened with that; I'm certain he would have loved to consummate
            the relationship, though I don't think they ever did. Whithin about
            one or two-week period Jim and Pam had looked into each other's eyes
            and realized that it wasn't going to be John Densmore at all, it was
            going to be Jim and Pam."

            <time>1967</time> The Doors release their debut album titled The
            Doors. It becomes very commercially successful. Light My Fire
            becomes a number one hit. The Doors appear on the Ed Sullivan show
            and perform Light My Fire. The producers told Morrison to change a
            line in the song, but when they played it live Morrison sung the
            original line. The Doors were told they would never play on the show
            ever again. Morrison is wrongly sprayed with pepper spray after a
            security guard thought he was a hooligan backstage. Morrison
            performs anyway, and in the middle of the performance Morrison tells
            the crowd of what happened, he calls the policeman “little blue
            pig”. Morrison is then arrested after the crowd got rambunctious. He
            becomes the first rock musician to be arrested onstage.

            <time>1968</time> On Wednesday, June 26, 1968, Jim Morrison and
            Pamela Courson went to Los Angeles City Hall and took out what was
            rumored to be their second marriage license, though the first one,
            said to have been picked up in Mexico shortly after the couple first
            met, no one remembers ever actually seeing. But any thoughts of a
            June wedding expired along with the marriage license, which was
            allowed to languish and die, unused.

            Morrison was at the Dinner Key Auditorium in Coconut Crove in
            Florida when he got naked in front of thirteen thousand fans. This
            got him a warrent for his arrest and he later on turned himself in.

            <time>1971</time> at the age of 27 Jim Morrison died in his bathtub
            due to hear failure in Paris. There is a conspiracy around his death
            saying he died of a heroin overdose at Sam Burnetts club and was
            carried back which he wrote in his book.

            <time>1974</time> On April 25, 1974, Pam died of a heroin overdose
            at the Los Angeles apartment she shared with two male friends. She
            was twenty-seven, the same age at which Jim Morrison died. Her
            parents intended that she be buried next to Morrison at
            Pere-Lachaise cemetery in Paris, and listed this location as the
            place of burial on her death certificate, but due to legal
            complications with transporting the body to France, her parents had
            her remains buried at Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana,
            California, under the name "Pamela Susan Morrison". After her death,
            her parents Columbus and Penny inherited Morrison's entire fortune,
            but their executor ship of the estate was later contested by
            Morrison's parents, George and Clara Morrison. In her funeral, The
            Doors told that nobody wore black clothes. Ray Manzarek played some
            songs that Jim composed thinking about Pam such as "Orange Country
            Girl". Nobody commented any thing related to Jim or Pam's life and
            death, they just remain there, in silence.
